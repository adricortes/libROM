       * @param[in] dim The dimension of the system on this processor.

       *                          sample is linearly dependent.

       * @param[in] fast_update If true use the fast update algorithm.
       * @param[in] initial_dt Initial simulation time step.
       * @param[in] samples_per_time_interval The maximum number of samples in
       *                                      each time interval.
       * @param[in] sampling_tol Sampling control tolerance.  Limits error in
       *                         projection of solution into reduced order
       *                         space.

       *                            containing the basis vectors.  Each process
       *                            will append its process ID to this base

       *                       disk when the object is deleted.  If there are
       *                       multiple time intervals then the state will not
       *                       be saved as restoring such a state makes no
       *                       sense.
       * @param[in] restore_state If true the state of the SVD will be restored
       *                          when the object is created.
       * @param[in] file_format The format of the file containing the basis
       *                        vectors.
       * @param[in] min_sampling_time_step_scale Minimum overall scale factor
       *                                         to apply to time step.
       * @param[in] sampling_time_step_scale Scale factor to apply to sampling
       *                                     algorithm.
       * @param[in] max_sampling_time_step_scale Maximum overall scale factor
       *                                         to apply to time step.
       * @param[in] debug_algorithm If true results of incremental svd
       *                            algorithm will be printed to facilitate
